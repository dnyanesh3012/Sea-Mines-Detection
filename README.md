# Sea-Mines-Detection 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of underwater objects detected by submarine sonar systems. Specifically, the focus will be on distinguishing between sea mines and non-explosive objects such as rocks. The project leverages data collected from submarine sonar scans to train and evaluate the model, contributing to improved maritime safety and submarine navigation.
# key points
1. Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from sonar data, considering characteristics that differentiate sea mines from rocks, such as shape, size, and acoustic properties.
2. Machine Learning Model Selection:
Evaluate and select appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.
3. Training and Validation:
Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the selected machine learning model using labeled data, optimizing for accuracy and minimizing false positives/negatives.
